== Description ==

The first GameRanger widget for wordpress designed by www.soslidesigns.com aka myself! I really
wanted a widget for WordPress because I like GameRanger and think it is a very underrated software.
What GameRanger does it allows you to play your old games that have "LAN" play and turns that into
multiplayer. So for instance if your game disabled there multiplayer feature but kept the "LAN" play
you can still play with friends from around the world with GameRanger. Very cool software!
